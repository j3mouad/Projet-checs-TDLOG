# Chess Game

## Description

This is a fully functional chess game developed using **Python** and **C++**. The game features a graphical interface built with **Pygame**, an AI opponent using **Stockfish** via **UCI (Universal Chess Interface)**, and various gameplay modes.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with **Pygame**.
- **AI Integration**: The game includes an AI opponent powered by **Stockfish** and the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.
- **Game Modes**:
  - **Player vs Player** (Local multiplayer)
  - **Player vs AI** 
  - **Custom game setups**
  - **Fairy Chess** (Custom rule sets)
  - **Fischer Random Chess (Chess960)**
- **Performance Optimization**: Python and C++ are integrated using **Sockets** for efficiency.
- **Chess Engine Analysis**: Game positions are evaluated using Stockfish’s evaluation function.

## Technical Stack

- **Python** (Main implementation language)
- **C++** (For performance-critical components)
- **Pygame** (Graphical user interface)
- **Stockfish** (AI Chess engine via UCI)
- **Sockets** (For communication between Python and C++)
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** (For AI decision-making)

## Challenges Faced

- Proper task distribution among team members.
- Debugging a large codebase.
- Integration between Python and C++ using sockets.
- Efficient representation of the chessboard.

## Future Extensions

- **Multiplayer Mode** (Online play)
- **Reinforcement Learning AI**
- **Improved User Experience** with additional features.
