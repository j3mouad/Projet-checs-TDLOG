# Chess Game Application

This project implements a chess game with graphical screens using Python.

## Overview of Screens

1. **Main Menu (Selection Screen)**  
   The first screen allows you to select color, time, and the type of game you want to play.

2. **Game Screen**  
   The second screen displays the chessboard, the time remaining, pieces captured, and includes an "Add Time" button.

3. **End Screen**  
   The final screen shows the winner of the match and includes a button to propose a rematch.

We want to develop an A.I. algorithm that allows to play with the machine. The code will be implemented in C++ with min-max algorithm.
This should be done in another by branch by another group. 

I have now linked the code between C++ and python. I used <pybind11/pybind11.h>. Now, I generate .so file that could be imported in python. 

My idea is to create a function in C++ Ai_generate that will take as an input a board , and a color and give you a move generated by AI that will be calculated with minmax Algortihm and with some form of pruning.
